//variable creation
//1. declare
//2. initialize

//primitive types
//objects - instance of a class (class the data type)

//statically typed = variables are given data types up front
//dynamically = variables do not have types
//data type - the type of the data. How the computer interprets the data

//literals - the value
//variable

//variable - stores some value, it changes 5, 10 etc
//expression - evaluates to a value
//operator - the + sign work on operands to produce a value
//operand - the thing the operator works on

//class - contains everything and has members
//methods - do something
//arguments - what you pass to a method(part of the calling)
//parameter - Variables to store arguments (part of definition)
//statement - telling the computer to do something
// properties - store something

//access modifier (public) - Who can use
//static - no instance of class is needed
//object - instance of a class
